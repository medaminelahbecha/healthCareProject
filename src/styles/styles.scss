// Main Stylesheet - Import all SCSS partials

// 1. Design Tokens (Variables)
// Contains CSS custom properties for colors, and SCSS variables for typography, spacing, etc.
// These variables are used across all other SCSS files.
@import 'tokens';

// 2. Base Reset
// A minimal CSS reset to normalize browser default styles and apply global settings.
// Includes box-sizing, default font, body background/color.
@import 'reset';

// 3. Core Component Styles
// Defines styles for reusable UI components like buttons, forms, cards, etc.
// These are class-based and can be applied to any HTML element.
@import 'components';

// 4. Utility Classes
// Helper classes for common styling patterns like spacing, flexbox, text alignment, etc.
// These are designed to be chained and used for fine-grained control over layout and appearance.
@import 'utilities';

// Note: The order of imports is important.
// Tokens should come first as other files depend on them.
// Reset should come before component and utility styles to ensure defaults are properly overridden.
// Components and Utilities can be ordered based on preference or dependency, though typically utilities might
// be used within components, so having them available (though not strictly necessary for SCSS variables/mixins)
// or for overriding purposes can be considered. For this setup, specific overrides are not the primary concern.
